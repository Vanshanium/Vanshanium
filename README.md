**Namaste!!!!!** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate philomath who firmly believes that with enough brain power, anything can be learned!
My current endeavor is learning automation and Rest API with Python as I explore deeper and deeper into Computer Science,Which fascinated me how early mathematicians and engineers crafted tools to make thier lifes easier that have now evolved to manage almost every aspect of our lives.
As a Neuroscience and Mathematics enthusiast, AIML fascinates me the most!.Which makes me forseek that Programming is going to be automated in near future,Hence I believe learning syntax of many languages is redundant,So, I focus more on C and C++ which are in the core(No pun intended!) of Computer Science.
